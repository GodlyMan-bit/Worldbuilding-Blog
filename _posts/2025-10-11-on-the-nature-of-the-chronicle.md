The **Chronicles** themselves have no certain origin. Some claim they were gathered by the Elders of old; others insist they appeared whole, as if born with the world itself. Yet all who study them agree on one thing — they are of immense importance to any who seek to understand the beginnings of **Aurelia**.

To those who do not know, the Chronicles are often called the _biography of the universe_ — a phrase both reverent and misleading. For the Chronicles do not tell one story, but many: they are a collection of writings, fragments, and testimonies of what once was. Some depict great battles; others, the quiet life of the farmer. Some are brief as a breath, others stretch across centuries. A few are written in tongues no one now recalls. Many contradict one another.

And yet, taken together, they form something far greater than history — a pattern woven with truth and falsity, with light and darkness. The Chronicles speak not merely of what _was_, but of how the world _remembers_ what was.

Those who attempt to order the Chronicles often fail, for they resist order. They do not begin; they emerge. They do not end; but fade.

Whether these writings came from mortal hand or from something beyond is uncertain. What is certain is this: through them, one may glimpse at the former glory of Aurelia.

The Chronicles are the story of common people — and though common, much is revealed:

> The Cartographer measured the lands and called them whole.  
> The Wanderer named the plains his home, ever seeking adventure.  
> The Noble wrote of former glory, of empires lost, of unspeakable war. – Poem dating to the 5th century, author Unknown

These days, Aurelia endures — but dimly. The golden age is long lost. What remains is fragmented, fractured; cold, sinful men, corrupters of pure light, now walk its halls.

> “If  write falsely, let the next hand correct me.  
> If I write truly, let the light bear witness.  
   For in shadow or in flame, Aurelia must be remembered.” – Caelentus, author of Testimonies
