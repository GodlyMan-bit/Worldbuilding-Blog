Far in the northern part of Aurelia lies Solareth, _the Land of Endless Sun_. Though its name may make it seem a lovely, warm place, it is most certainly not. Much of Solareth’s surface is covered in tundra, evergreen forests, and snowcapped mountains. During the summer months, the sun hangs low in the sky, illuminating Solareth and never truly setting.

Mountains older than memory crown the land, their peaks standing watch over the entire realm. Along its coasts, ice-clad cliffs—said to be shaped by giants now long lost—shelter the mainland from the raging sea.

Inland stretches a vast wilderness of pines and tundra, where the forests whisper of secret things—fallen and divine. The northern lights, the _Aurora Caelestis_, dance above the frozen sky, said to be the lingering tears of angels who once walked the land before it was darkened by sin.

Amid the silence stand ancient monoliths, carved with the runes of the First Covenant, their meaning now forgotten. Some say they mark the graves of seraphim that wept; others say they guard the portals to realms unseen.

Yet in all its severity, Solareth is not a dead land. It is a land of culture, history, and heritage. In its brief and glorious summers, the meadows burst into radiant color, and the birds flutter through the air. In the forests, all manner of beasts roam and claim the ground as their home. Bees hum through the air, and streams run sweet from the mountain peaks. At the very height of summer, there are great feasts across the entire realm. The _Feast of Sun_ marks the very start of the Solari calendar. Every village—from the glaciers to the meadows—takes part in this glorious celebration.

From then on, the weather faces a sharp decline. The green of summer soon changes to the auburn of fall. At this point, all creatures make preparations for the cold months ahead. Rabbits clean out their burrows, birds begin the great journey south, and bears fatten themselves for winter. The colors then quickly fade, and the ice begins to settle—winter just around the corner.

White, fluffy snow blankets the ground, and the harsh, bitter cold does not relent. The lofty pines of the forest are weighed down with sheets of ice, and all the rivers and lakes stand as solid as stone. Creatures of all kinds are holed up in their warm abodes.

Though winter bears down with terrible might, the Solari people do not despair. They are a hardy folk—descendants of settlers and saints who tamed the frozen wilds through faith and endurance. In their stone halls and timber homes, they gather around the hearth to sing the old hymns of light, passed down since the days of the First Covenant.

Their faith is unlike that of any other in Aurelia. To them, the sun is not merely a star, but a divine emblem—the visible reminder of the Creator’s unbroken promise to drive away the darkness. Each dawn is greeted with prayer; each sunset, with thanksgiving. Even in the long nights of midwinter, when the sun’s face is hidden for months, they kindle their lamps and say, _“The Light still shines, and the darkness shall not overcome it.”_

In the heart of every settlement stands a **Solarium**, a great hall of worship open to the rising sun. Its windows are cut from the purest crystal, refracting the light into every color of the heavens. Within, priests clothed in white and gold proclaim the ancient creed: that Solareth was chosen to bear witness to both the fury and mercy of heaven—to endure the frost, and yet reflect the warmth of divine light.

When spring returns and the snow begins to melt, the Solari hold the **Festival of Dawn**, a solemn yet joyous celebration marking the sun’s victory over the dark. They dance upon the thawing earth, singing of redemption, of light restored, and of the One who kindled the heavens in the beginning. It is said that on the first morning of the festival, when the sun rises over the mountains, its light touches the monoliths of the First Covenant—and for a brief moment, they shine like living fire.

So stands Solareth: harsh, radiant, and unbroken. A land that endures by grace, where faith burns brighter than flame, and where even amid the endless frost, the people remember the promise that gave them their name—**the Land of Endless Sun.**
